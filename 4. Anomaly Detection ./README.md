Anomaly detection is one of the common applications of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). By computing the reconstruction loss for each datapoint and thresholding it, one can identify data points that are significantly different from the majority of the data. These data points can then be considered as anomalies or outliers. This approach can be useful in various domains such as fraud detection, fault detection, and quality control.

Here's an example code for anomaly detection using a trained VAE in PyTorch:
```
import torch
import numpy as np

def anomaly_score(x, recon_x, mean, logvar):
    # Compute reconstruction loss
    BCE = torch.nn.functional.binary_cross_entropy(recon_x, x, reduction='sum')
    # Compute regularization term
    KLD = -0.5 * torch.sum(1 + logvar - mean.pow(2) - logvar.exp())
    # Return the combined loss
    return BCE + KLD

def detect_anomalies(model, data, threshold=3.0):
    # Encode data into the latent space
    mean, logvar = model.encode(data)
    # Reparameterize to sample from the latent space
    z = model.reparameterize(mean, logvar)
    # Decode the latent code to reconstruct the data
    recon_data = model.decode(z)
    # Compute the anomaly score for each datapoint
    anomaly_scores = anomaly_score(data, recon_data, mean, logvar)
    # Threshold the scores to identify anomalous data points
    anomalies = np.where(anomaly_scores.detach().numpy() > threshold)
    return anomalies

# Load the trained model
model = ...
# Load the test data
data = ...
# Detect anomalies in the test data
anomalies = detect_anomalies(model, data)
# Print the indices of the anomalous data points
print("Anomalous data points:", anomalies)
```
In this example, the anomaly_score function calculates the combined loss of the reconstruction loss and the regularization term. The detect_anomalies function takes the trained model and the test data as input, encodes the data into the latent space, reparameterizes to sample from the latent space, decodes the latent code to reconstruct the data, and computes the anomaly score for each datapoint. The anomalous data points are then identified by thresholding the scores.
